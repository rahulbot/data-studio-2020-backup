Their project was in relation to contamination of groundwater in Ohio due to hydraulic fracturing. They showed not only the data, but the process for gathering that data and discussions of the impact of that data.&#160; They specifically show the amount of gasoline range organic (GRO) and diesel range organic (DRO) compounds for given locations around Ohio in relation to &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/10/effects-of-hydraulic-fracturing-on-groundwater-contamination/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Effects of Hydraulic Fracturing on Groundwater Contamination</span></a>]]></description>

It uses a warm color palette and mostly numerical data to show how many people have been infected, how much money was allocated by China to fight against the outbreak, and how much the virus has spread around the world. It also calls out the death toll of the disease, shows a timeline of the disease&#8217;s progression, and shows the magnitude of its presence &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/06/spread-of-2019-ncov/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Spread of 2019-nCov</span></a>]]></description>

One aspect shared by mostly all the innovative technologies though, is the general trend they follow, starting from low key discoveries, until reaching maturity and widespread use. Gartner, a global research and advisory firm, developed a general framework that captures all innovative technologies and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/06/navigating-buzzwords/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Navigating Buzzwords</span></a>]]></description>

For example, children from Hixson, TN who grew up in the poorest of households are likely to see little income mobility, though they fare better &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/06/the-opportunity-atlas/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Opportunity Atlas</span></a>]]></description>

The graphic shows sleep habits and literary output for various famous writers, ordered starting with Honore de Balzac who woke up at 1am and ending with Charles Bukowski who would get up at 12pm. It packs a good amount of information into a small icon for each writer – name, lifespan, wake-up time, number of books &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/06/sleep-habits-of-famous-writers/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Sleep Habits of Famous Writers</span></a>]]></description>
