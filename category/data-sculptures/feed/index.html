					<description><![CDATA[This is a representation of yearly CO2 emission per year by SUV&#8217;s vs midsize cars, the 2 piles of soil are used to represent the weight of CO2 produced per year, the pile next to the tree represents the CO2 absorbed by a tree per year. Gardening soil is used to represent CO2 emissions because of its resemblance partly because of its imagery of pollution and partly due to availability.

					<description><![CDATA[by Eileen Hu I sketched out a data sculpture idea using the NYC street tree data that I worked with in sketch 1 (https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/03/05/trees-in-nyc-sign-up-to-help/) This sculpture would be an installation in Central Park near a playground so it would get traffic from kids. The sculpture would have umbrellas &#8220;planted&#8221; in the ground, creating a &#8220;street&#8221; lined with the umbrellas that people could walk down. This connects to the idea that street trees provide shelter and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/raining-data/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Raining Data</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The sculpture uses the grape harvest dataset to show the harvest date across three different years. The glass contains the same quantity of liquid but coloured according to a colour scale ranging from red to blue. The earlier the date is the redder the glass, while the further ahead in time, the bluer the content, reflecting the hotter temperature experienced with earlier harvest dates (striking summer) and colder climates going towards Autumn. The year is &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/661/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Climate Change&#8217;s Impact on Wine</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sule Kahraman For my data sculpture I chose to work with Grape Harvest Dataset https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/13194 because I had a few wine bottles laying around. In this sculpture I try to represent the change in the rate of grape harvest in France, hence I used only the French bottles. The number of bottles for each century maps to the grape harvest volume in that century. I chose to represent the future with a wine glass that has &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/climate-change-threatening-wine/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Climate change threatening wine</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[-Sarah Mousa I was inspired by the bee dataset and chose three data points tied to bee colonies from the state of California from 1989; 2000; and 2016. These three data points show a drop in bee colonies, by 30% from 1989 to 2000 and by 50% from 1989 to 2016. Description: I used honey (a product of bees) to demonstrate the proportion drop in bee colonies (in this case, in the state of California &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/no-more-honey/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">No More Honey</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used the grape vine as a sculpture of the geographic story about how climate change has affected wine. I tried to incorporate three senses (taste, touch, sight) to capture more of the data. Taste: I poked holes in the grapes on the bottom of the vine and soaked the grapes in a sugary solution for a couple of hours. After this, the grapes on the bottom were significantly sweeter (disgustingly so) than the non-soaked &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/sickly-wine/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Sickly wine</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For this sculpture, I revisited our first sketch (  https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/03/05/the-city-in-bloom/ ) The sculpture attempts to be an approximation of a tree, where the different branches are all the different trees that are in bloom in a neighborhood right now. Larger branches correspond to a larger population of trees (in this sketch, the white flowers have the largest branch), and the number of branching moments corresponds to the number of tree species that fit in that &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/branching-out/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Branching Out</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For this sketch, I created wire sculptures to represent the proportion of trees in New York City that are in good health. These wire sculpture kits would be handed out to students in a New York City elementary school art class, with 80% of the students with materials to create a healthy tree (green tree), and 20% of the students with materials create an unhealthy tree (brown tree). The idea is that after students notice &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/trees-in-nyc-school-art-project/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Trees in NYC: School Art Project</span></a>]]></description>

The medium is a video in a wine store or a restaurant and the audience is people who visit this establishment. The goal of this video is to make people, who love wine aware of the fact that they might not have their favorite wine a few years down the line and encourage them to donate to causes which &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/keep-calm-and-drink-more-wine-unless-you-cant/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Keep calm and drink more wine, unless you can&#8217;t!</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to experiment with using water as a medium for data storytelling. In particular, I thought water could be an interesting way to tell data stories through other senses like taste and touch. The dataset I&#8217;m using is the air World Air Quality Index Project dataset. In the original data story I worked on, we tried to make pollution tangible by showing it through video filters.
