					<description><![CDATA[Project by: Cynthia Hua, Devin Zhang, Gaurav Patekar In the participatory game project, We created a web-game, Cars in Space!, to provide a fun and accessible educational experience on why and how to choose greener cars. We used the Environmental Protection Agency’s Fuel Economy Data which shows how fuel-efficient cars can produce drastically lower CO2 emissions, while also saving the driver money due to reduced gas costs. Link to the sketch: https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/22/cars-in-space-a-data-game/ As the game was well fleshed out in terms &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/05/12/impact-assessment-cars-in-space/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Impact Assessment &#8211; Cars in Space</span></a>]]></description>

Vunabandi created a tool to narrow down car choices based on user preferences. You can find more information in our previous blog post linked here and see our original tool pictured below. Current Project               Based on the feedback from last time, we overhauled the tool to make it easier to use and the results clearer.

					<description><![CDATA[Sule Kahraman, Hamed Mounla, Sarah Mousa The data says that correlations between economic growth rates and carbon emissions vary widely across country. We want to tell this story because it could undermine a key argument for non-restrictive emissions policies and drive greater policy actions towards curbing environmentally-harmful emissions.&#160; Original Post: The original blogpost we used for this assignment is on charting correlations between CO2 emissions and economic growth.

					<description><![CDATA[Sam Ihns and Claudia Chen For our impact assessment, we collected feedback on the wine label sketch (here) from the maps/creative maps unit. Because this sketch came from a commercial perspective, we sought to survey the most promising commercial audience. We found that in the U.S., over 40% of all wine is consumed by millennials (source), so we surveyed 20 millennials to gain more insight about the effects of our historical wine labels.&#160; Before iterating &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/05/11/wine-label-feedback-collection/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Wine Label Feedback Collection</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[by Eileen Hu I sketched out a data sculpture idea using the NYC street tree data that I worked with in sketch 1 (https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/03/05/trees-in-nyc-sign-up-to-help/) This sculpture would be an installation in Central Park near a playground so it would get traffic from kids. The sculpture would have umbrellas &#8220;planted&#8221; in the ground, creating a &#8220;street&#8221; lined with the umbrellas that people could walk down. This connects to the idea that street trees provide shelter and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/raining-data/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Raining Data</span></a>]]></description>

The glass contains the same quantity of liquid but coloured according to a colour scale ranging from red to blue. The earlier the date is the redder the glass, while the further ahead in time, the bluer the content, reflecting the hotter temperature experienced with earlier harvest dates (striking summer) and colder climates going towards Autumn.
