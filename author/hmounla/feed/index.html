I map the data by varying the precipitation with the number of glasses of water uses and varying the temperature with the number of candle wicks used. My sculpture includes a timeline &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/29/ghd-and-climate-factors-data-sculpture/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">GHD and Climate Factors Data Sculpture</span></a>]]></description>
