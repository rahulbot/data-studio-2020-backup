We created a full 1-minute Instagram video, with stock photos and videos of people drinking wine, vineyards &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/05/12/advocating-for-climate-change-by-advocating-for-wine/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Advocating for Climate Change by Advocating for Wine</span></a>]]></description>

The glass contains the same quantity of liquid but coloured according to a colour scale ranging from red to blue. The earlier the date is the redder the glass, while the further ahead in time, the bluer the content, reflecting the hotter temperature experienced with earlier harvest dates (striking summer) and colder climates going towards Autumn. The year is &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/04/30/661/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Climate Change&#8217;s Impact on Wine</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By Eugenio Zuccarelli, Olivia Yao and Sam Ihns Bee population has experienced a dramatic decline over the last decades as the data say, bringing the colonies of some states in particular to record lows. We aimed at targeting farmers who can take action to effectively help to restore bee populations to sustainable levels, by using interactive questionnaires where the farmer can input his answers.

					<description><![CDATA[How climate change impacts wine By Eugenio Zuccarelli, Tyler Millis and Neil Pendse Wine-making has become not just like any other form of activity, but almost an art. An art that over these 700 years has become not only a pleasure for the palate but a form of alternative investment, especially in uncertain times. An art so important that we have detailed records of the grape-harvesting dates for the last 700 years.

I texted friends with WhatsApp and, despite it claims end-to-end encryption, I also use Signal since it should be a more secure and privacy-focused app. Even if the content of the messages was not collected as plain text, it is most likely that encrypted &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/24/eugenios-data-log-24-feb-2020/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Eugenio Zuccarelli&#8217;s Data Log &#8211; 24th Feb 2020</span></a>]]></description>

Gartner, a global research and advisory firm, developed a general framework that captures all innovative technologies and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/06/navigating-buzzwords/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Navigating Buzzwords</span></a>]]></description>
