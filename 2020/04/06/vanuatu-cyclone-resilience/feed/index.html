					<description><![CDATA[This is an incredibly detailed, strong narrative sketch that pulls from multiple sources of data.

Centrality of maps: 
Your introductory map showing the paths of various storms in relation to Vanuatu is well framed, but visually hard to digest. In a further iteration I’d suggest making these thin lines so they don’t occlude the geographical context. On the other hand, the sheer scale of the storms definitely comes across! The animation is well used. Narrowing into the path of Pam, and supplementing with satellite images works well.

Rationale for design choices: 
Your post-presentation segment documents your rationale for the time period and geographic focus quite well.

Layers of reading: 
Starting with the broad context and then narrowing into cyclone Pam is a nice way to dig deeper. I imagine I’d be able to explore the map of the various cyclones manually if I was there in the room with you.

Appropriate data use:
You’ve looked at the paths of storms and narrowed into a specific region that is greatly effected - this feels appropriate to me.

Suitability for audience:
Your slides are overly dense, which sadly is exactly what the audience for this kind of presentation would probably expect.

Narrative:
Casting yourself as a resilience project is a good simplifying decision to make your context very clear here. Your “first chapter” effectively moves from the broader context to your specific concerns. The photos are a solid addition to humanize the toll of the storms. The data you provide about the impact of Pam is a nice way to rationalize the requests you make for help in “chapter 2”.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the animation and the bright colors used on the map, it does a great job of clearly illustrating the issue of severe cyclones.

I think it would have been great to include discussion of policies that could be implemented globally that could redirect money to places like Vanuatu that are especially vulnerable to climate change but are not high emitters. This graph could be used to argue for policies such as carbon taxes and natural capital calculations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really interesting narrative. I think the animation is a good way to convey your message and your analysis is clear. One thing I would change in the animation is either the colors of the your wind knots or the relative scale as it is difficult to visualize right now. Otherwise you could select fewer cyclones to include in the graphic]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There was a lot of great things to this presentation. I liked seeing both the global view of the cyclones around the South Pacific regions, which kind of appeals more to one&#039;s pragmatic side, and zooming in on one specific place in Vanuatu, which really appeals on one&#039;s  emotional side and makes the cyclones &quot;real&quot;. It was also nice that the presentation was done as if the pitch was real (i.e., under 3 min like it&#039;d be in this kind of proposal).

One thing that could improve would be the original map. During the presentation, as you were speaking, the map was already animated from the start well before you said what the map was showing. That was confusing and distracting. Also, there was a lot of things on the map (which seems to have been a design choice?), but I still feel like it could have been made a bit cleaner maybe by using transparent colors (so that they can stack on top of each other but we as readers of the map can still see where each cyclone started/went).

Otherwise I really liked the sketch :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought the animation was really well done! It was very informative to see the cyclones slowly being played out over time rather than just seeing them all at once on a map. I think that visualization alone draws people in and really drives home the point you are making about how hard this area was hit. Especially, thinking it is so affected by changes in carbon emission, yet doesn&#039;t contribute much itself.

I wonder if making the colors more transparent would be better since there are so many cyclones over each other. It is easy to see that there are many cyclones in one area, but transparency on the color might show that more clearly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! Thank you for sharing your work. 

I was drawn to your project because the bright neon colors in the map were quite eye-catching. It made me think immediately that there was a complex data narrative here to unpack. 

That being said, I wished the map would have provided me with more guidance upon closer observation. For example, the legend was a bit hard to read as the symbols did not look exactly like the symbols on the map. There was also no text or title on the map that might have guided my eye-line more — it would have helped to have some of the things you said during the powerpoint labeled or highlighted visually on the map as an accompaniment.]]></description>
