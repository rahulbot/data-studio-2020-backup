					<description><![CDATA[I really like the visual dynamics in this sketch as well as how interactive the game is. One way you might want to improve it is not only to use the scaling as a means to show the data but also potentially the levels in terms of accessing different types of cars by placing the more fuel efficient cars in the more advanced levels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is amazing, super cute game and concept. I think it makes visible some of the invisible impacts of buying a car in a really compelling way - such a bummer that we had to go to space to get there. 

Echoing another comment, if you were to develop it further, it could be interesting to have sliders that allow someone to put in the specs of a car not in your library, or of their current car make/model to then compare them against the recommended ones in your guide.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice job here created a take on how to inform people about the environmental load and economic impact of their car purchase, with lots of detailed parts integrating the data. A well fleshed out sketch.

Centrality of participation: 
The whole piece is an interactive game, where you make decisions based on representations the car data. Participation is very central.

Rationale for design choices: 
Doing a playful game makes sense for this audience to me. The visual treatment is strong and echoes the playful approach. In future iterations I’d like to see some justification that young people are a significant portion of car purchases, or miles travelled, or something like that to justify focusing on them.

Layers of reading: 
There are strong multiple layers presented here.I like the multiple approaches here, from the car cards, to the data-based game outcomes, to the pollution alerts. The game report you get at the end is another example of this.

Appropriate data use:
You’ve got a few dimensions of data about each car on the cards. The pollution data is also based on real information. The money and pollution data are well represented in the game play and mechanics.

Suitability for audience:
Targeting young folks making decisions is a good narrowing in on an audience to help you make reasonable design choices. I can easily imagine the ad campaign that would accompany this game’s launch. A quick reminder - some people enjoy shopping for and comparing between cars (not me, but I know some folks that do).

Narrative:
Rule-based design is tricky, but I think you’re starting from a good spot. Ideas like unlocking new cars are a nice nod to ways to keep it interesting and surprising.  I’d consider doubling down on the Tesla-in-Space link to help the game make sense and respond to current-ish events.

Call to Action:
I like the “save mankind” goal. The idea of generating a “game report” at the end as a takeaway is a solid start at thinking about what the potential longer-time impacts of the game experience could be. The hopes to educate the audience about the potential impact of their choice, so the call to action is well aligned with the audience description.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really love the concept of this game and also the graphics, it&#039;s really neat. One thing that you can probably work on is the point system. Right now you are rewarding more efficient cars by increasing earnings. But I guess if you penalize less efficient cars by reducing the earnings of the players, it will create a bigger impact. You can also change the graphics according to how efficient the cars are. For eg. if a car is good then the graphics are positive but if a car is bad then there&#039;s smoke or something else which is negative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this game is a really creative way to communicate fuel efficiency and gas mileage, and there are some great graphics in the sketch.

To make this more directly engaging to an audience who may be looking to buy a car, you could consider making the car selection more flexible in the beginning to allow users to filter to a certain brand or price range, and then &quot;unlock&quot; similar cars as the game progresses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like how you&#039;ve made this data so accessible! I especially like how you take the individual car and scale it up to the entire world and then contextualize that with the earth&#039;s current carbon emissions. I also like how the game makes the connection between an environmentally friendly car and a car that saves you money - a win-win! I think something you could continue to iterate on is the tone of the game. The visuals and language in the game seem like they&#039;re targeted to an audience that&#039;s younger than 18-40. Maybe you could make the game for kids and the call to action is telling their parents what car to get. Or you could change the graphics, language, and/or setting to seem more appropriate for the 18-40 range.]]></description>
