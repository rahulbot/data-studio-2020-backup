					<description><![CDATA[I think this is very interesting! Would be fun to have a follow-up quiz after you&#039;ve informed your audience about their environmental footprint where you can buy your car based on emissions rather than money, which (in a market-efficient world) should be similar to buying cars based on price because the externality of carbon emissions would be priced in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a nice example of an interactive piece to see your point in a multi-dimensional space of choices, and could benefit from some more thinking about how the pieces fit together.

Centrality of participation: 
This is clearly inspired from the choice-driven examples we showcased, and I think it follows the invitation pattern well. I’m glad you were able to mock this up in HTML; that really helps understand how it feels to go through the interactive.

Rationale for design choices: 
The interactive matches the idea of an online car magazine pretty well. The results of the interactive are a little hard to read - I think further iteration is needed to make it clear and self-explanatory.

Layers of reading: 
The article and the invitation to put in your own criteria are the main layers here. The results visualized add more in. I can see the path to further information, but would appreciate a stronger link fro the quiz back to the accompanying article (because I think the quiz is a lot more shareable online). You suggest this in the video, and I think it is a good idea.

Appropriate data use:
Your sample selection is justified well. I like the addition of the price data and the rationale for it. The bar chart of pollution vs. cost has an aesthetic feel that matches the idea of a car magazine (for me), but doesn’t really match the rest of the visual treatment. You’re highlighting a bunch of the dimensions of comparison here, but I think you aren’t remembering some of the lessons from the “charts and graphs” sketch - ie. echoing the story of the chart with text above, removing extraneous decoration, etc.

Suitability for audience:
Casting yourself as a car magazine obviously resonates well with the dataset you’ve chosen to work with. I think the data dives would appeal to the technically minded of those readers, that that glut of charts probably makes sense here.

Narrative:
The story that pairs with the interactive has a nice lead in - focusing in on sports cars and pollution. I think have a tighter link between it and the interactive would help us understand how they fit together.

Call to action:
The audience here is those thinking about buying a car, so your goal of informing them more based on the data about the cars makes sense. The interactive accomplishes that well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! It was cool to see another group use car data for their project. We also did that for our project and your tool reminded me of a similar tool on the EPA&#039;s website to help consumers make car buying decisions.

I think integrating the data into an algorithm is a smart way to make this tool — so the average car buyer doesn&#039;t have to think about any of the small details. One suggestion I would have is that I think many tools to help consumers pick cars based on a preference quiz do exist already, so I would be interested in a feature or design that might make your tool more unique. For example, I think graphics and design can do a lot to communicate to a particular audience. Anyways, thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like the idea behind the sketch, to create a simple car filtering tool based on your preferences and suggesting green options within your budget and requirements. 

One thing that might be helpful for the user is to suggest options that are considerably better for the environment but lie slightly outside your selection, for example, if the user has selected a standard SUV and there&#039;s a greener small SUV option, that sketch could also suggest that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really love the tool! It&#039;s simple and effective. If you are going to productionize this sketch you can probably make the graphics more attractive to the user. And probably you can also tweak your model so that it is biased towards producing energy efficient results!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is a great way to help somebody view possible options for a car purchase. The list of questions seems clear and well-organized, and can serve as a checklist for things that the user may want to consider when buying a car. It&#039;s also fairly flexible, allowing the user to opt out of certain decisions or select a large price range.

One minor suggestion if you were moving this beyond the sketch stage would be to integrate the choices with the graphs a bit more (perhaps side-by-side), so it feels more interactive. That way, it is easier for the user to switch between options and see what changes.

I think that the encodings in the pollution to price comparison can be a little bit confusing to read. The lines connect across discrete (I think) score ratings, and for a single score, it is not clear that the different points represent parts of the same distribution. In addition, I would question whether you need to encode the avg price with thickness when you already have the 50th percentile as an &quot;average&quot; measure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this would be a really helpful tool! It&#039;s great because it solves a problem for a user while nudging them in a societally positive direction. Something that I might think more about is the number of charts you show to the user. Maybe you would have changed this in a more hi-fi version of the sketch, but seeing all the visuals on one page was a bit overwhelming. Since the user is using the tool to make their life simpler, it feels like the charts add more complexity than necessary. Maybe you could have options to go deeper in certain areas for the most interested users.]]></description>
