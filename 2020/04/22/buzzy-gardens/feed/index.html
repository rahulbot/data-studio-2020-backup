					<description><![CDATA[The aesthetic and concept of the game is great - reminded me of Catan and can imagine it being played. 

The main risk here is around clarity of message. While the game appears educational and based on state-specific information (which is great) it is not clear to me what the narrative is and what data it aims to highlight. Players may walk away with more information on bee livelihoods but not clear that they&#039;ll walk away with a particular message/sense of call to action]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! Thank you for sharing your project. One thing I really appreciated was the clean and eye-catching design. The game cards look fun and appealing and make me want to learn more. I also think the open layout of the game is a very neat creative feature that is a suitable to an educational game because it allows the player to determine their own path through the game.

One suggestion I might have is that it might be interesting for you to explore more game elements that are purely for fun rather than tied to the data/learnings. I think the game gives an accurate depiction of issues that might affect bees, but I also think I would be more inclined to play the game if it had more fun language or more exciting/unexpected twists.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Feedback
This is a great first pass at a game with playful participation based on the observations you made of the data; and I’m sure would need more rule-iteration based on play-testing.

Centrality of participation: 
The entire invitation is a game, which of course is very participatory. Each round requires decision making based on a model of the real-world affordances and constraints.

Rationale for design choices: 
The playful design connects well with the context you’ve set up. The design of the gameplay seems good at first pass - of course it would take playing it to suss out how the rules function. 

Layers of reading: 
Some of this comes through with the regional constraints - ie. how many hives CA needs and such.

Appropriate data use:
You’ve worked the data representation here in reasonable ways - the event cards, the region cards, etc. Your idea of segmenting the types of flowers is a good way to model some of the information about ecosystem and pollinator-friendly plants. I assume the event-cards, and the amount of each, is based on some of your data analysis. Having the data inform the game design is fine; not all data stories present the data directly - sometimes they represent the story in the data.

Suitability for audience:
You’ve narrowed down nicely with your choice of who you are, and a clever idea of rewarding the donators with this game.  If I donated, I’d try the game out.

Narrative:
Your promo video is a nice example of embracing this presentation format to fit into your story. The components come together to tell a story about how bee hives can be healthy, and how the ecosystems around them can support them. It is hard to tell without playing the game, but I get the sense that the a “happy and healthy” goal comes through well.

Call to Action:
This is kind of funny because one action has already been taken - donating. The idea of regional expansion packs to raise money is quite clever. And you’ve got the social sharing invitation at the end as well. The suggestion here is that playing the game educates the participants more, and the design decisions seem well aligned around that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like the overall idea, especially using the game perspective to inform people. I particularly liked the game rules PDF which looks just like a boardgame handbook and the overall esthetique. I believe though there might have been more exploration in terms of how the mechanics of donation/distribution of the game. 

If the game is distributed to people who have already donated, they might not be the best audience for this game, since, having already donated, they probably already are aware of the importance of bees. Maybe, a different mechanic could have been that the game is distributed for free in kiosks, and the costs would be recouped by the following donations through a call to action after the game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The game seems really well done and put together. Bravo on the art and thought put into it. I feel like this could easily be a normal board game instead of one purely thought to teach people about bees. It seems there would be a lot of repeatability and variability due to the starting scenarios and finding ways to maximize the point total at the end.

While this game matches its audience (donors and home gardeners), I think it would have been interesting to hear about a plan to sell this game normally. It may not be the most wide-reaching game, but I feel like it could be sold in stores, which would also help get others interested in the cause. With that approach, I think there could be more specific messaging or details included with or shown in the game so people could learn more about the topic if wanted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really liked the approach of the game. The game is super simple to think about, and it can help donators better understand the impact they are having. 

One drawback I feel here is that, maybe there was not enough &quot;hardship&quot; in the game. Like, I am not sure whether the game was hard enough in such a way that it could help one really understand what kind of challenges are bees facing or beekeepers are facing. I also wished there was a bit more of the data incorporated in the game (but a disclaimer here is that I didn&#039;t look at this data thoroughly so I am not actually sure what is &#038; isn&#039;t there to talk about).]]></description>
