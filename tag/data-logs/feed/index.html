					<description><![CDATA[I started my day in the Student Center, as I worked there overnight Sunday. The study space has tap access so every time I used the bathroom or filled up my water bottle I would use my ID giving location data and information about the usage of the space. I bought a plane ticket. This is notoriously a process that takes a lot of data using cookies. I also bought this ticket after monitoring a &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/25/data-log-ifeoluwapo-ademolu-odeneye/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Data Log &#8211; Ifeoluwapo Ademolu-Odeneye</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chatting with people I have a very sick (not in the cool way) morning ritual. Every day literally starts with me snoozing the alarm and then checking my notifications for any messages which popped up during the night (people who come from places halfway across the earth will empathise with me)! I use quite a few applications to chat with people. People back in India prefer using WhatsApp. Friends and classmates here in the US &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/25/neils-data-log-2-24/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Neil&#8217;s Data Log (2/24)</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chatting with People The majority of my interpersonal communication takes place via gmail, Facebook messenger, and Slack. A couple of days ago I read that Facebook has started fully encrypting their messages, so I guess there is no way that could be used as a data set. In the evening I had a conversation with a friend that I&#8217;m sure was picked up by their Amazon Echo. I also intermittently messaged friends via Signal throughout &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/24/data-diary/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Data Diary</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chatting with People On this day, I used Messenger and Snapchat to communicate with others. I mainly messaged about what I was doing that day, both with pictures on Snapchat to my friends or message updates to my girlfriend on what I was doing and when I would be back. My snaps could locate me at MacGregor, at Boda Borg, and the place I went to dinner at. If someone wanted to, they could easily &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/24/tylers-data-log-february-22/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Tyler&#8217;s Data Log &#8211; February 22</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chatting with People I was in constant communication with people over WhatsApp and IMessage throughout the day, including sharing a playlist I made on Spotify with two people who then both used it to run – which I’m sure Spotify noticed. Around 2 I logged into the MyFitnessPal app to enter what I’d eaten in the day, and was prompted to allow location access, which I said yes to without thinking, and then immediately paused &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/02/24/patricias-data-log-2-23/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Patricia&#8217;s Data Log 2/23</span></a>]]></description>
