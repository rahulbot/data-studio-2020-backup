					<description><![CDATA[I really like how you took a really relevant medium (filters) and added important information to it. I&#039;ve never thought about filters in a positive light like this, and I think using filters for advocacy is actually a great idea. One suggestion I would have would be to modify the call to action to make it more clear to the user.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is very interesting! Would be fun to have a follow-up quiz after you&#039;ve informed your audience about their environmental footprint where you can buy your car based on emissions rather than money, which (in a market-efficient world) should be similar to buying cars based on price because the externality of carbon emissions would be priced in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like the visual dynamics in this sketch as well as how interactive the game is. One way you might want to improve it is not only to use the scaling as a means to show the data but also potentially the levels in terms of accessing different types of cars by placing the more fuel efficient cars in the more advanced levels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The aesthetic and concept of the game is great - reminded me of Catan and can imagine it being played. 

The main risk here is around clarity of message. While the game appears educational and based on state-specific information (which is great) it is not clear to me what the narrative is and what data it aims to highlight. Players may walk away with more information on bee livelihoods but not clear that they&#039;ll walk away with a particular message/sense of call to action]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[**NOTE: I think you’ve linked to the wrong game - this doesn’t match your video at all**

I think this is a well thought-out idea for a game that is hard to get a feeling for from the sketch materials.

Centrality of participation: 
The project is a game, so it is clearly participatory. In addition the choices between rounds is another spot to let the audience guide it.

Rationale for design choices: 
The game design matches your stated educational goals. Having the participant be the bee is fun. I’d like hear more about the idea of mapping potential bee health onto the amount of buildings. I wonder if this mapping would make sense to a kid - needs some design discussions with the target audience to see.

Layers of reading: 
The game itself is pretty simple, but the idea of having this be one piece of a larger curriculum on nature makes sense. I would have liked to see more thought about the gameplay itself - what design elements would be critical and highlighted, what techniques for playing could be supported.

Appropriate data use:
I appreciate your acknowledgement that the data and potential causes are complicated.

Suitability for audience:
The choice of focusing on a younger audience is good, and creates challenges.

Narrative:
The game play and narrative prompts for this audience have to be highly visual - I don’t see a lot of that in the sketch so far so I’d encourage more iteration on that if you were to move forward. The idea of mulitiple-rounds is a nice approach to this.

Call to Action:
Your invitations of what to do match the game overall, and I like that you include both individual action and collective observation. These all sound fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great - my favorite feature is that it is tailored to an individual&#039;s location, I think many would be interested in local air quality and drawn to the game because of that. I do think this format would be appealing to a young audience.

I&#039;m not sure that I would label it as a game, more as interactive data. I think that the link to a specific action is great - although the action itself may need to be something more convincingly effective in addressing air pollution.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is solid start for an interactive kiosk, but needs some more thinking about how people move beyond the first layer of the interaction.

Centrality of participation: 
The overall design as an interactive display invites participation. That display is also a survey, reinforcing the participatory element. I appreciate the thinking about letting people scan their purchases to learn more about their environmental impact (though I wonder how the retailer would feel about that potentially discouraging purchases of lucrative items).

Rationale for design choices: 
Small note - when you “see the answer” that screen should show the participant what they guessed (so they don’t forget).

Layers of reading: 
I think the quiz piece would benefit from a “learn more” invitation after the participant is shown if they were right or wrong. Overall I would have liked to see more of your thinking about how the participant could dive deeper (if they are stuck in a long, slow moving line for instance). 

Appropriate data use:
The high-level introduction is data-centered  nicely. I like that you focused in on one state based on further research into the context of the data.

Suitability for audience:
The idea of putting an interactive display in farm-supply stories seems reasonable, and gives you good constraints for your other design choices.

Narrative:
The title is a solid take on trying to turn this into a story, and sets the tone for the Q&amp;A quiz-like format of the first piece of the interactive.

Call to Action:
I like the call to scan the items you are buying, and you suggest that there’d be a way to learn more about their impact. I would have liked to see a suggestion for how this could be included.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked how the quiz format allows the user to literally see themselves in the data and how the goals are very clear. The format allows you to inform the quiz-takers and share data as a way to back up your claims.
It would be nice to see more options in the quiz if you had more time to work on it -- as it is right now, it&#039;s conceivable that someone could take this quiz and answer no to three lifestyle questions and end up having less incentive to move to Bangor at the end of the quiz. It could also be interesting to have some kind of ranking of how good your situation is based on your current city vs other cities, to get more context. It would probably be too judgey to incorporate lifestyle choices into those rankings, but if there were other questions that the quiz asked that were directly connected to how the quiz-taker is affected by air pollution (maybe &quot;how much time do you spend outside in the city&quot;?), that could contribute to a final ranking (eg you&#039;re in this percentile for air pollution effects out of the people who have taken this quiz).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a nice example of an interactive piece to see your point in a multi-dimensional space of choices, and could benefit from some more thinking about how the pieces fit together.

Centrality of participation: 
This is clearly inspired from the choice-driven examples we showcased, and I think it follows the invitation pattern well. I’m glad you were able to mock this up in HTML; that really helps understand how it feels to go through the interactive.

Rationale for design choices: 
The interactive matches the idea of an online car magazine pretty well. The results of the interactive are a little hard to read - I think further iteration is needed to make it clear and self-explanatory.

Layers of reading: 
The article and the invitation to put in your own criteria are the main layers here. The results visualized add more in. I can see the path to further information, but would appreciate a stronger link fro the quiz back to the accompanying article (because I think the quiz is a lot more shareable online). You suggest this in the video, and I think it is a good idea.

Appropriate data use:
Your sample selection is justified well. I like the addition of the price data and the rationale for it. The bar chart of pollution vs. cost has an aesthetic feel that matches the idea of a car magazine (for me), but doesn’t really match the rest of the visual treatment. You’re highlighting a bunch of the dimensions of comparison here, but I think you aren’t remembering some of the lessons from the “charts and graphs” sketch - ie. echoing the story of the chart with text above, removing extraneous decoration, etc.

Suitability for audience:
Casting yourself as a car magazine obviously resonates well with the dataset you’ve chosen to work with. I think the data dives would appeal to the technically minded of those readers, that that glut of charts probably makes sense here.

Narrative:
The story that pairs with the interactive has a nice lead in - focusing in on sports cars and pollution. I think have a tighter link between it and the interactive would help us understand how they fit together.

Call to action:
The audience here is those thinking about buying a car, so your goal of informing them more based on the data about the cars makes sense. The interactive accomplishes that well.]]></description>

I liked how you tailored your goals to the medium and the audience, focusing on making the video filter simple and engaging. This campaign makes the topic of air pollution more approachable and shareable. 
The connection to COVID-19 and the reduced air pollution from shelter-in-place restrictions does make this video filter more relevant to the current time period. I wonder if this might lull users into a false sense of security and thinking that everything is fine now that we&#039;ve reduced pollution a bit,even though pollution will likely get worse again once restrictions are lifted. And since the future is modeled based on taking action today, it feels like the users just have to go along with the default option to get that better future with less air pollution. It would be nice to be able to see the future if we don&#039;t change anything, then give a way for users to &quot;unlock&quot; the green filter, as other people have suggested.]]></description>
